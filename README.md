1. Sorting - This is a C++ program that performs Insertion,Selection or Bubble sort according to the option chosen by user. It also allows user to create array of desired size.

2.Merging two sorted arrays such that the merged array is itself sorted (in increasing order).

#Subset Sum Problem
1. Recursive approach -
    Time complexity : This problem is NP-Complete meaning there is no known polynomial time solution for this problem .
                      In worst case it will try all the subsets and time complexity is exponential.
                   
2. Top Down Approach -
    Time complexity : Pseudo polynomial time meaning the running time is polynomial in numeric value of input but not necessarily in length of input.
                      
3. Memoization -
    Time complexity : As it checks the complete matrix of size sum*n, hence time complexity is O(sum*n) .                      

#Equal Sum Partition
1. Recursive approach -
    Time complexity : O(2^n)
    
2. Dynamic Programming Approach - 
     Time complexity : O(sum*n)
     
#Count number of subsets 
1. Recursive approach -
    Time complexity : O(2^n)
    
2. Dynamic Programming Approach - 
     Time complexity : O(sum*n)

#0-1 Knapsack Problem
1. Recursive approach -
    Time complexity : O(2^n)
    
2. Dynamic Programming Approach - 
     Time complexity : O(n*C)

#Minimum Difference Problem
1. Recursive approach -
    Time complexity : O(2^n)
